# Obsidian-Highlight-Mode

Elevate your Obsidian note-taking experience with the Highlight Mode Plugin! This intuitive tool makes emphasising key points a breeze, allowing you to focus on what truly matters.

Key Features:

• Effortless Text Highlighting: Simply select the text you want to emphasise, and the plugin automatically wraps it with == markers, followed by %% %%.

• Seamless Commenting: After highlighting, your cursor is conveniently placed between the %% markers, inviting you to add comments, annotations, or personal insights without missing a beat.

• Smart Highlight Management: The plugin intelligently recognises and skips text that’s already highlighted, preventing duplicate formatting and keeping your notes clean and organised.

How It Works:

1. Activate Highlight Mode: Toggle the Highlight Mode on or off using the command palette or your preferred hotkey.

2. Select Text: In Highlight Mode, choose the passage you wish to emphasise. 

3. Automatic Highlighting: The plugin instantly applies the highlight and positions your cursor within the %% markers, ready for you to type your comments or continue editing seamlessly. Note: do NOT delete the %% from the text manually or the plugin may face errors ignoring your text section.

With the Highlight Mode Plugin, enhancing your notes becomes second nature. Whether you’re emphasising crucial information or adding personal annotations, this plugin ensures a smooth and efficient workflow within Obsidian.

Note: This plugin operates entirely within your local Obsidian environment, ensuring your data remains private and secure.

How to Install:

Download folder
Copy the folder to you .obsidian -> Plugins folder (make sure hidden files are visible on finder/explorer)
Activate in the community plugins section
Command Pallete > toggle highlights mode on. You can assign a hotkey as well if you liked.


---
Now if you install the plugin 'Enhanced annotations' from the Obsidian community plugins section, you can have a separate toolbar where you can see all your highlights/comments in a separate toolbar. Just like on the Kindle app! (or other reader apps for that matter)
